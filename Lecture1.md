## What is object oriented programming?

Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that
focuses on data manipulation, making it easier for the programmers to use.

## What are the basic concepts of OOP?

Basic concepts of OOP are readability and reusability. Code written using OOP
is easy to implement and reuse for different projects, even by users unfamiliar
wiht the code at hand.

## What are the main principles of OOP?

The main principles of OOP are Encapsulation, Abstraction, Inheritance and
Polymorphism

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the process of wrapping the data and methotds that act upon
the data together, making a neat little shawarma roll (sorry, I'm hungry)

## Abstraction

Abstraction is the process of taking the bits and pieces we need from a source
and using them, not needing to look at all of the other data in the Encapsulated
package. This makes it easier to grab a box of tools, and using only the hammer,
rather than inventing the hammeer again, or buying a new hammer every time we
need one.

## Inheritance

Inheritance is a very cool thing, as it allows us to make new things that has
the same information as old things. Making a change upstream, will have that 
change cascade down through the inheritance tree, unless of course it was 
individually overridden through Polymorphism.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism is when the child classes have differences from their parents. 
Sometimes getting new variables, new methods, inheriting from multiple parents
etc. Also, this is how multiple objects of the same class can have individual 
data.
